This is a Samuel Y Huang's personal blog. I'm an aspiring internal medicine physician with an analytical background in Biometry and Statistics from Cornell. I believe data can advance medicine and improve outcomes. As someone deeply fascinated by the complexity of both the human body and Math, I hope to communicate big data transparently to inform patients and make a difference.
You can find more of my research at [**ResearchGate**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel-Huang-10) and on Pubmed.
